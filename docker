# Step 1: Use the official Maven image to build the application
FROM maven:3.8.6-openjdk-17-slim AS builder

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the pom.xml and the source code to the container
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src

# Build the application with Maven (skip tests to speed up the process)
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Step 2: Create a new image with only the runtime environment
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built jar file from the builder image
COPY --from=builder /app/target/wine-manager-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /app/wine-manager.jar

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the Spring Boot application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "wine-manager.jar"]
